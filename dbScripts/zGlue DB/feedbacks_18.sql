,('suggestion for function','feedback','As I''ve mentioned in WeChat group, I prefer the following functions.
1. In the chipset list view (in zGlue''s web), I prefer the list of chiplets in PDF or Excel to find overview.
2. In the chipset list (in ChipBuilder and zGlue''s web), I prefer the link to its datasheet in selection. I can''t know its function from its component number and manufacturer name. Although the detailed datasheet is not needed, I want to know the abstract of functions, such as category (MCU, ADC, ...) and the summary of its function (CortexM0, 12bit ADC, etc, ...)

2. For chiplets, I prefer the more small, simple MCUs, such as NPX''s LPC11A02 or Microchip''s ATtiny or PIC.
